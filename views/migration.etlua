<span class="title-text">Migrating from the Snap<em>!</em> Cloud to the new Beetle Cloud system</span>
<p>Beetle Blocks is now using a new storage system, which was a necessary step towards being able to implement a social site like this one, in which users can share projects with each other, explore and remix projects made by others.</p>
<p>For well founded security reasons, it is impossible for us to access your data in the old cloud, which is why we cannot provide you with an automated way to transfer your projects from the Snap<em>!</em> cloud to the new system.</p>
<p>If you had saved projects to the cloud in Beetle Blocks before, you will need to download them into your PC and upload them back into our new system.</p>
